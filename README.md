# Privacy Graph Extension

This project is created fro my bachelor thesis. You can use this extension to analyze your HTTP-requests in browsing sessions. You can also flag malicisous domains and block requests on simple metrics.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
It will start without a conncetion to the chrome extension. So it will only show dummy data.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Runs the build script and packs the extension into the dist folder


## Installation
To install the extension into chrome just run the `npm run build` command. And select the dist folder as extension in chrome. It should then run as expected.
