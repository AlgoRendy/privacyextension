# PrivacyExtension

## Summary
This project is created fro my bachelor thesis. You can use this extension to analyze your HTTP-requests in browsing sessions. You can also flag malicisous domains and block requests on simple metrics.

This extension can be used to display the user's web traffic in real-time. The traffic is represented within an HTTP-Referrer graph utilizing the Chrome API.

Note that the code is not optimized yet.
